# ssh-key-hunter
Collect and catalog SSH keys

Usage example:

./do-it_ssh-key-hunter /home/$(whoami)/key-hunt-servers.txt

The key-hunt-servers.txt is line delimited host names of servers that you are collecting the ssh keys from.

The do-it_ssh-key-hunter script is a wrapper for ssh-key-hunter and ssh-key-reporter.
